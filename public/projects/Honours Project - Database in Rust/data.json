  "about": "This was the project I did for my honours year (2019-2020), for my Computer Science Bachelor's Degree. It was randomly allocated among 7 of my choices, this was my second choice. My first was building a weather forecast system. I chose this project because I wanted to learn more about the nitty-gritty details of how databases work, at a system level. The other reason was that part of the challenge of the project was to first learn Rust and use it to develop the database. I was intrigued, as Rust is famous for having a hard learning-curve but also for its incredibly memory and concurrency safety issues. It was built by improving upon the mistakes of C/C++ and implementing the best elements of the most popular programming languages, such as asynchronicity (Node/JS) and  functional programming features similar to those in Haskell. The compiler is infamously aggressive which is why when programming with Rust, a lot of the coding involves pleasing the compiler! Thank to that however, when the code runs it is almost guaranteed to be technical-issues free."
